# FrontEndMasters Course Section Title Scraper

This does NOT scrape courses, that is illegal and I highly encourage people to get a FrontEndMasters subscription because it offers amazing content. 

This just grabs the course section titles from a specific course.

I made this for personal reasons to grab section titles when making a learning curriculum for my Notion planner.

In the process, I wanted to learn a bit of Puppeteer and it's capabilities, thus this was born.

In essence, this may or not help you out but it also shows a simple example of Puppeteer DOM selection of multiple elements.
